## Quick Start
To use bHive, you must compile the client ("bee") and the server ("queen") separately.
This can be done by using uflash for pip3, or by going to the [MicroBit MicroPython Online Compiler](https://python.microbit.org/).

When you've flashed both your "queen" and "bee" chips, holding down the A button on the queen
will make it scan for connected clients, to execute the given command.

Pressing the B button will execute the current command.
